          Note that this analysis only takes into account U.S. markets; international markets, such as emerging markets, could be much more volatile, and so the performance values could conceivably be lower.

          This analysis assumes a diversified stock portfolio. Also, the return stream does not take into account product, advisor or other expenses that an investor might incur. It also does not consider the effect of taxes.
